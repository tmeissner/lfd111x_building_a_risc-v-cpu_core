[![tests](https://github.com/tmeissner/lfd111x_building_a_risc-v-cpu_core/workflows/tests/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/tmeissner/lfd111x_building_a_risc-v-cpu_core/actions?query=workflow%3Atests)

The original repository is located on my own git-server at [https://git.goodcleanfun.de/tmeissner/lfd111x_building_a_risc-v-cpu_core](https://git.goodcleanfun.de/tmeissner/lfd111x_building_a_risc-v-cpu_core)

It is mirrored to github with every push, so both should be in sync.


# lfd111x_building_a_risc-v-cpu_core

Code from the Linux Foundation course [*Building a RISC-V CPU Core*](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFD111x+1T2021/home) at edX. I have added VHDL implementations equivalent to the TL-Verilog ones.
